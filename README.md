This is a learning path to prepare for the MountBlue Selection process

To prepare for your selection process you can practice all easy questions on the [HackerRank algorithms](http://hackerrank.com/) track.  

You can get a significant advantage in our selection process by completing Responsive Web Design Certification and Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on  https://learn.freecodecamp.org/.
